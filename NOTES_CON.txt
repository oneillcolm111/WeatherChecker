Test passing - No - 404 error response when 201 expected - Diagnosis - endpoint not configured properly, ran out of time to properly diagnose

Other issues - due t hardware and time i was struggling to populate the db with the openweathermap info

# Notes

With more time and I would have fixed the endpoint issues with the 404 error. All ingredients are in the project I just ran over time and 
was unable to finish completely
As a tester my next steps would be
- Test Coverage - as we add more endpoints we would need to ensure that all endpoints are covered and that endpoints themselves are functionally tested
- Error Handling - adding error handling to catch errors from the API either expected errors or unintentional
- remove the hardcoded data - use parameters or stubs to enter variable relevant dynamic data
- Test setup and teardown - Maybe add this to ensure each test starts from same clean slate
- Add more assertions to the tests or outputs to the tests to increase the Coverage
- Add negative scenarios to the testing
- Add smoke / regression suites and functional hapy path suites
